# Task Manager Tutorial

## Checks for Understanding

1. Define CRUD.

    CRUD is an acronym standing for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the basic functions that Rails can help us implement to interact with our database

2. Define MVC.

    MVS is another acronym, this time standing for Models, Views, and Controllers. These are the pieces that work together to allow users to interact with our API

3. What two files would you need to create/modify for a Rails application to respond to a GET request to /api/v1/tasks, assuming you have a Task model.

    You would need to create a tasks_controller and update your routes

4. What are params? Where do they come from?

    Params are parameters that are passed in through the request. We can use routes to format particular params.

5. What is the purpose of a serializer?

    A serializer will format the response before sending it out.
